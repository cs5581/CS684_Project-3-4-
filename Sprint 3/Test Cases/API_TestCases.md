API Test Actions : 

- Verify Correct HTTPS Code: creating a resource should return 201 CREATED and unpermitted requests should return 403 FORBIDDEN. 
- Verify Response Payload: Check correct field names, types, and values â€” including in error responses.
- Verify response headers: HTTP server headers have implications on both security and performance.
- Verify correct application state: This is optional and applies mainly to manual testing, or when a UI or another interface can be easily inspected.  
- Verify basic performance sanity: If an operation was completed successfully but took an unreasonable amount of time, the test fails.
